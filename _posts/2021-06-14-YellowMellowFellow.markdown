### <u>Overview</u>
This project is based on the original Pac-Man with a personal touch which was done as part of assessment for module CSC2034.
The base of the scene and logic of the game was provided by the University as part of introductory material to games engineering and Unity.
Tasks and extensions were set as part of assessment to expand upon the game. 

**Workflows used**: Git and Agile. **Technologies used**: C#, Unity Game Engine.

***Note**: Due to the project being part of my degree assessment code is not available publicly.*
