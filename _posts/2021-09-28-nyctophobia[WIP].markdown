### <u>Overview</u>
nyctophobia - scared of the dark. 

Project for CSC3232 - Gaming Simulations and Technologies. Grade achieved: 91%.

Project mainly looked at physics in games and interacting with the engine. Logic of core opponents included complex algorithms as taught throughout the module such as Markov Decision Process, pathfinding, min/max tree search for best/worst case scenario for final boss fight.

As I am not allowed to disclose my code due to University regulations of assessment, you can play the game down below!
